# Automated-ARDF-System
This repository contains the code for my bachelor's thesis titled "Implementation of an Automatic Radio Direction Finding System"

The development and implementation of a system for organizing and conducting
radio direction finding (ARDF) competitions are presented in this paper, with the aim of
creating an efficient solution that enables automatic tracking and logging of the discovery of
radio transmitters in real time. The main purpose of the system is to assist competitors in
accurately locating transmitters using XBee communication modules in combination with
the Arduino platform. The system automatically records the time required to find the
transmitters and allows the user to easily manage the competition through a graphical user
interface.
The methodology of the work includes the configuration of a ZigBee network using
XBee modules, the implementation of serial communication between the computer and
Arduino devices, and the development of an application to manage the competition. The
developed application provides users with a visual display of the results. Tools such as the
XCTU software for configuring XBee modules and Visual Studio for application
development were used in the process.
The main research findings demonstrate that the application of XBee technology in
such systems is highly efficient, providing stable and accurate communication between
devices. The system is designed to be user-friendly, reliable, and easily adaptable for future
expansions, making it suitable for organizing ARDF competitions.
The conclusion of the research is that this system improves the regularity and
efficiency of competitions. Foundations have also been laid for future development,
including simplifying device usage and expanding to larger competitive networks.
